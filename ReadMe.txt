Digit_detection:
ex1.ipynb includes the models for recognizing digits of Mnist,
and also includes the code to predict my own images.

There is a .py file which also can predict own images.
To predict own images:  1) put images in the "images" folder ( There are some images there already )
			2) make sure you have "img_resized" folder ( will be fiiled by the program )
			3) make sure you got the "best_model" folder with the model in it
			4) run the .py file or the ipynb jupyter notebook ( the wanted part of the code )

The "Reports" folder holds 3 Word docx with the metadata about the models.

Animals_flowers_detection:
Ex2.ipynb includes the models for recognizing animals from Cifar, and also
includes the fine tuned model for recognizing flowers

There are 2 .py files:  1) recognize own images of animals
			2) recognize own images of flowers or not flowers

predict own images:
	animals: 1) put images in the "images" folder ( There are some images there already )
		 2) make sure you have "img_resized" folder ( will be fiiled by the program )
		 3) make sure you got the "best_model" folder with the model in it
		 4) run the .py file or the ipynb jupyter notebook ( the wanted part of the code )

	flowers: 1) put images in the "images_transfer" folder
		 2) make sure you have "img_resized_transfer" folder ( will be fiiled by the program )
		 3) make sure you got the "saved_model_transfer" folder with the model in it
		 4) run the .py file or the ipynb jupyter notebook ( the wanted part of the code )

The "Reports" folder holds 3 Word docx with the metadata about the models.
